## Setup: Sample employees Collection 🏢
First, let's insert some sample data into an employees collection to use for our queries.

db.employees.insertMany([
{
employee_id: 101,
name: "Sonia Rao",
department: "Engineering",
salary: 95000,
hire_date: new Date("2023-01-15"),
performance_score: 4.5,
status: "Active"
}, {
employee_id: 102,
name: "Rajesh Kumar",
department: "HR",
salary: 68000,
hire_date: new Date("2024-03-22"),
performance_score: 4.1,
status: "Active"
}, {
employee_id: 103,
name: "Arjun Singh",
department: "Engineering",
salary: 120000,
hire_date: new Date("2022-06-01"),
performance_score: 4.8,
status: "Active"
}, {
employee_id: 104,
name: "Priya Mehta",
department: "Sales",
salary: 85000,
hire_date: new Date("2023-11-10"),
performance_score: 4.2,
status: "Active"
}, {
employee_id: 105,
name: "Vikram Reddy",
department: "Sales",
salary: 85000,
hire_date: new Date("2024-08-01"),
status: "On Leave"
}

]);
## 1. Comparison Selectors ⚙️
These operators compare the value of a field against a specified value.
$gt (Greater Than) & $lte (Less Than or Equal To)
▪ Goal: Find all employees with a salary greater than $90,000 but less than or equal to
$120,000.
▪ Query:
db.employees.find({
salary: { $gt: 90000, $lte: 120000 }
})
▪ Explanation: This query finds documents where the salary is between 90,001 and
120,000, inclusive. It will find Sonia Rao and Arjun Singh.
$in (In an Array)
▪ Goal: Find all employees who work in either the "HR" or "Sales" department.
▪ Query:
db.employees.find({
department: { $in: ["HR", "Sales"] }
})
▪ Explanation: The $in operator selects documents where the department field's value
exactly matches any value in the provided array. It will find Rajesh Kumar, Priya Mehta,
and Vikram Reddy.
$ne (Not Equal)
▪ Goal: Find all employees whose status is not "On Leave".
▪ Query:
db.employees.find({
status: { $ne: "On Leave" }
})
▪ Explanation: The $ne operator selects all documents where the status field value is
not equal to the specified value.

## 2. Logical Selectors
These operators are used to combine multiple query conditions.
$and (Implicit)

▪ Goal: Find employees in the "Engineering" department with a performance_score of
4.5 or higher.
▪ Query:
db.employees.find({
department: "Engineering",
performance_score: { $gte: 4.5 }
})
▪ Explanation: When you list multiple fields separated by a comma in a find() query,
MongoDB treats it as an $and condition by default. This is the most common way to
combine conditions. This query will find Sonia Rao and Arjun Singh.
$or
▪ Goal: Find employees who are either in the "HR" department OR have a salary greater
than $100,000.
▪ Query:
db.employees.find({
$or: [
{ department: "HR" },
{ salary: { $gt: 100000 } }
]
})
▪ Explanation: The $or operator takes an array of condition objects and selects
documents that satisfy at least one of the conditions. This will find Rajesh Kumar
(matches department) and Arjun Singh (matches salary).
## 3. Combining Selectors for a Complex Query ✨
Real-world scenarios often require combining multiple operators.
▪ Goal: Find all Active employees in either the Engineering or Sales departments
who were hired before 2024.
▪ Query:
db.employees.find({
status: "Active",
department: { $in: ["Engineering", "Sales"] },
hire_date: { $lt: new Date("2024-01-01") }
})
Explanation: This query implicitly uses $and to combine three conditions:
1. The status must be "Active".
2. The department must be one of the values in the $in array
3. The hire_date must be less than ($lt) the specified date.
